[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/catalyst-network/wasm-ed25519/_apis/build/status/catalyst-network.wasm-ed25519ph?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/catalyst-network/wasm-ed25519/_build/latest?definitionId=18&branchName=master)[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/629667101774446593?color=blueviolet&label=discord)](https://discord.gg/anTP7xm)

Provides [ed25519ph](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek) functionality.

## Install

First up make sure you have rustup nightly installed.

If this is a fresh install and you have no rustup toolchain use the following:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain nightly
```

If you currently have the stable release do

```
rustup install nightly
```

Since we are using nightly you need to override wasm-packs default tool chain by doing...

```
rustup override set nightly
```

Next you need to ensure you have node/npm installed. The easiest way is through node version manager (NVM)

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install lts/carbon
nvm use lts/carbon
```

For further instructions on NVM refer to their repo https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

You can build with:

```npm run build:prod```

Then view using:

```npm run start```
